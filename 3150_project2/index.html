                <p>In a world where people have diverse abilities, how are we able to make website designs universal for everyone, and account for everyone's needs?</p>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Universal Design is a design concept that respects and accomodates as many people as possible, regardless of their current abilities.</p>
                <p>In the USA alone, there's ~44 million people with a disability, which represents roughly 13% of the country's population. It would make no sense to create a design that communicates with under 90% of people rather than 100%.</p>
                <p>Hence, designers and developers will need to take advantage of current accessibility tools and methods to design for everyone.</p>
