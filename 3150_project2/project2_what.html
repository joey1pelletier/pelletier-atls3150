                <h3>Universal Design</h2>
                <p>When it comes to human abilities, there is a diverse range of what people are capable of. These range from sense (sight, vision, hearing) disabilities to neurological disabilities.</p>
                <p>Universal Design is a method that can account for anyone, regardless of their abilities.</p>
                <p>Hence, designers and developers will need to take advantage of current accessibility tools and methods to design for everyone. For example, a developer will need to code HTML in a way where it can be read by a keyboard controlled screen-reader.</p>
                <p>Most importantly, designers should BEGIN with a universal design approach, rather than having it during the end. That way, the design doesn't treat universal design as a last-minute item.</p>

                <h3>An Accessible UI Framework</h2>
                <p>As a way for designers and developers to practice universal design, they can follow the following framework.</p>
                <h4>Clear Purpose</h3>
                <p>Products are made for the audience and made with a purpose.</p>
                <h4>Solid Structure</h4>
                <p>The design must be stable and secure. It should be easily digestable to all users.</p>
                <h4>Easy Interaction</h4>
                <p>User can use the product with all versions of interactivity, whether it's through a screen-reader or a special visual tool.</p>
                <h4>Clean Presentation</h4>
                <p>The product's design is not filled with an abundance of noise, and can be easily understood by all users.</p>
                <h4>Plain Language</h4>
                <p>The product's information is easily accessible and understandable.</p>
                <h4>Accessible Media</h4>
                <p>People can understand the product's images, videos, animations, etc.</p>
                <h4>Universal Usability</h4>
                <p>Users can focus on their experience of the product, rather than having the product getting in the way of the user.</p>
